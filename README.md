# Stepper Motor Learning Project
**Date:** 3/12/2023

This is a small project designed to **understand and verify the theory** learned about stepper motors.  
The code in this project is **not optimized** and is intended for educational purposes only.

## Purpose
- Review and validate knowledge of stepper motor control.
- Experiment with different motor stepping modes.

## Hardware Used
- **NEMA 17** stepper motor  
- Base step angle: **1.8° per step**
- **L298N & Bluepill F103C8T6**

## Motor Modes in Code
| Mode | Step Resolution | Step Angle |
|------|----------------|------------|
| Half-step | 1/2 step | ~**0.9°** |
| Micro-step (1/16) | 1/16 of half-step | ~**0.9° / 16** ≈ **0.05625°** |

> Note: This is a study project. The code focuses on illustrating the concept and is **not optimized** for performance or real-world applications.
